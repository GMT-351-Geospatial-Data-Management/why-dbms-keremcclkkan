What is a database?

A database is a computer system that stores data arranged in tables with rows and columns, as well as documents or files.
What is DBMS?

The software to create a database and manipulate data in it is called a database management system (DBMS). It is an interface that allows users to query data, manage tables, and perform other data manipulations within the database. 

What is a spreadsheet?

A spreadsheet app or program is a software that allows you to manipulate the data in a spreadsheet. The most famous spreadsheet apps today is MS Excel.
Each spreadsheet app has its own data limits. Microsoft Excel has the following limits:
Up to 1,048,576 rows
Up to 16,384 columns 

In total, an Excel Worksheet can have 17,179,869,184 cells considering other limits.

Similarities between databases and spreadsheets

The only similarity between these two notions is that both spreadsheets and databases can store data in a tabular format.
A spreadsheet is a table or a collection of tables, so is the database. However, databases can store a huge number of tables compared to spreadsheets. This is the main difference out of many more, which we’re going to discuss below. 

Differences between databases and spreadsheets

•	Data volume

You can use spreadsheets to store and manage large quantities of raw data. But there is a limit to the data you can upload.
With databases, your main issues may relate mostly to the performance restrictions rather than data volume limitations. 

•	Data storage and manipulation

Spreadsheets are tables consisting of rows and columns. A cell is the confluence of a row and a column.
Databases store data values in tables, which are the simplest objects (structures) for storing data.

•	Data formatting

Spreadsheet applications give you many options for determining the formatting, appearance, and structure of data.
Databases store and output data in a tabular format. You can’t change the format or somehow visualize the data.

•	Data shareability

Database management systems let multiple users access and edit data.
Spreadsheet apps can not boast such a level of shareability.  

•	Domain knowledge 

Spreadsheet apps are indisputably beginner friendly. They are designed with user focus in mind.
Databases are more difficult to use and require a higher level of technological expertise, including the SQL.
